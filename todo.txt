CLEANUP:
- remove all ID routes, use only URL
- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- standardize language (mixes vs mixtape)
- put mixes in static folders

FEATURES (MVP):
- add CSS
- add user avatars
- add user pages
- add description to tracks
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- add download links / currently converting to index
- add track amounts / totals to index
- add limit to number of tracks that can be added
- add art to index page
- allow removing tracks as creator of mixtape
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion

FEATURES (EXTRA):
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- random mixtapes?
