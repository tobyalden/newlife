CLEANUP:
- remove all ID routes, use only URL
- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- standardize language (mixes vs mixtape, remove "flaskr" name)
- put mixes in static folders

FEATURES (MVP):
- allow deleting mixtape as creator of mixtape
    - delete: converted mp3 (if exists), all tracks, mixtape itself
- add limit to number of tracks that can be added
- automatically convert on track maximum
- rename mixtapes to correct name on download, and add art + tracklist to description
- add tracklist to finished mixtapes
- add download links / currently converting to index
- number tracks

- add CSS
- add description to tracks
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion
- show all mixtapes contributed/created as user
- paginate index page

FEATURES (EXTRA):
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- random mixtapes?
