- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- standardize language (mixes vs mixtape)
- put mixes in static folders

FEATURES (MVP):
- add CSS
- add art to index page
- add user avatars
- allow removing tracks as creator of mixtape (or adder of track)
- allow deleting mixtape as creator of mixtape
- add download links / currently converting to index

- add user pages
- add description to tracks
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- add limit to number of tracks that can be added
- allow mixtapes to be public/private
- suggest making private mixtapes public on conversion

FEATURES (EXTRA):
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- random mixtapes?
