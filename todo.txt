- add album art
- add user pages
- add user avatars
- remove all ID routes, use only URL
- add description to tracks
- validate all actions in routes (logged in, owns mixtape, mixtape not locked/is available, etc).
- add comments section to mixtapes?
- add CSS
- prevent fullpage reloads where possible
- add download links / currently converting to index. also track amounts / totals
- add limit to number of tracks that can be added
- allow removing
- allow mixtapes to be publicly/privately viewable AND publicly/privately editable
    - this suddenly creates the problem where you would have to either add users manually as editors or have an edit URL that was secret and separate...
    - OR maybe you just say "make public on conversion!". and if public/private is editable to begin with that's just a convenience feature
- random mixtapes??
